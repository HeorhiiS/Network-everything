First three chapter of "Linked" by Barabasi give out an impression of the pleasurable quality 
and overall intellectuality of the book, the author, and the subject. 
The first chapter was an eye-opening on how networks are important to day-to-day life and the future. 
I was indeed surprised by how integral they are. 
Second and third chapters were full of good information regarding the history and the structure of various networks. 
The concepts of critical link number and degrees of separation were well explained and provoke the curiosity and desire to read the rest of the book.
